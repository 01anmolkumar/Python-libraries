The bug continues to occur if no name is given to the Series, but does not occur when `to_csv()` is given the argument `header=False`, yet this behaviour should be universal.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nFloating point numbers should be formatted according to the specification in `float_format` when saving using `to_csv()`.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.12.2.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 11\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 140 Stepping 1, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : English_Australia.1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : None\\r\\npip                   : 24.1.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.2.1\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.6.1\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.1\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.3\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.14.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.31\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>',\n",

However, it currently does not support the direct conversion of strings representing numbers in different bases (hexadecimal, octal, and binary) that use standard prefixes. Adding this feature would enhance the function\\'s utility and align it with the conversion capabilities found in core Python functions and PEP standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nModify the pandas.to_numeric function to detect strings starting with 0x (hexadecimal), 0o (octal), and 0b (binary) and convert them to their corresponding integer values.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n- Hexadecimal Strings:\\r\\n  - Prefix: `0x` or `0X`\\r\\n  - Example: `0x1A` should convert to `26`.\\r\\n- Octal Strings:\\r\\n  - Prefix: `0o` or `0O`\\r\\n  - Example: `0o32` should convert to `26`.\\r\\n- Binary Strings:\\r\\n  - Prefix: `0b` or `0B`\\r\\n  - Example: `0b11010` should convert to `26`.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\ndef extended_to_numeric(series):\\r\\n    def convert_value(value):\\r\\n        if isinstance(value, str):\\r\\n            if value.startswith((\\'0x\\', \\'0X\\')):\\r\\n                return int(value, 16)\\r\\n            elif value.startswith((\\'0o\\', \\'0O\\')):\\r\\n                return int(value, 8)\\r\\n            elif value.startswith((\\'0b\\', \\'0B\\')):\\r\\n                return int(value, 2)\\r\\n        return pd.to_numeric(value, errors=\\'coerce\\')\\r\\n    \\r\\n    return series.apply(convert_value)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Example usage\\r\\ndata = pd.Series([\\'0x1A\\', \\'0o32\\', \\'0b11010\\', \\'42\\', \\'invalid\\'])\\r\\nnumeric_data = extended_to_numeric(data)\\r\\nprint(numeric_data)\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_',\n",

This requires being able to set a ```attribute=value``` defined as ```custom-style=\"Footnote Text\"```, which allows Pandoc to apply a docx style.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nFigure out how to either add attributes from the series or dataframe or implement a Styler component which adds attributes which get put into the jinja2 template. It\\'s clear this was intended, but not implemented.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nThe alternative would have me making custom templates for every table I need, rather than allowing pandoc to naturally adapt styles\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nI could probably implement this feature but it\\'s obfuscated how the render goes from accessing a cell and putting that into a render function.\\r\\n\\r\\nI assume it can be a mirror image of the ```set_table_styles``` function and instead but ```set_table_attributes``` unless the intention was to use the ```Dataframe.attrs``` or ```Series.attrs```.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way, some clear direction could get this implemented.',\n",

However, it requires the user to specify `bins` as either an integer or a list of bin edges. I wish it was allowed to specify `bins='auto'` similar to how `np.histogram` allows it. It internally leverages `np.histogram_bin_edges` to compute these. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expectation\\r\\nInstead of coding \\r\\n`pd.cut(df['x1'], bins=np.histogram_bin_edges(df['x1'], bins='auto'))`\\r\\nAllow for coding\\r\\n`pd.cut(df['x1'], bins='auto')`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculation of bin edges is already done via `np.histogram_bin_edges`.

However, information about the original position of each element within its list is lost. This makes it difficult to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Easily access specific sub-values after exploding.\\r\\n- Reconstruct the original nested structure if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Proposed Solution:**\\r\\nIntroduce a new parameter, `offset`, to both `df.explode()` and `s.explode()`.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example Usage:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> s = pd.Series([[1, 2, 3], \\'foo\\', [], [3, 4]])\\r\\n>>> s\\r\\n0    [1, 2, 3]\\r\\n1          foo\\r\\n2           []\\r\\n3       [3, 4]\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n>>> s.explode() # <- Current behavior:\\r\\n0         1\\r\\n0         2\\r\\n0         3\\r\\n1       foo\\r\\n2       NaN\\r\\n3         3\\r\\n3         4\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\n>>> s.explode(offset=True) # <- With proposed feature\\r\\n0  1         1\\r\\n   2         2\\r\\n   3         3\\r\\n1  1       foo\\r\\n2  1       NaN\\r\\n3  1         3\\r\\n   2         4\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nIntroduce a new parameter, `offset`, to both `df.explode()` and `s.explode()`.\\r\\n```\\r\\ndef explode(self, ..., offset: bool = False):  # Default to False for backward compatibility\\r\\n    \"\"\"\\r\\n    Parameters:\\r\\n        ...\\r\\n        offset: If True, include the original array offset as a level in the resulting MultiIndex.\\r\\n    \"\"\"\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nWhile it\\'s technically possible to infer the offset in some cases, it requires additional steps and assumptions about the data.
